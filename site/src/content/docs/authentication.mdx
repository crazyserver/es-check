## Overview

The Access Shield offers robust authentication mechanisms to ensure secure user access to your application's resources. It includes features such as user registration, login, session management, OAuth integration, two-factor authentication (2FA), and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **User Registration**: Allow users to create new accounts with a chosen username and password.
- **Login**: Enable users to authenticate themselves with their credentials.
- **Session Management**: Manage user sessions to maintain authentication state across requests.
- **OAuth Integration**: Integrate with OAuth providers for seamless authentication via third-party services.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Strengthen account security with an additional layer of authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Control user access to resources based on their roles and permissions.

## Getting Started

To begin using the authentication features of the Access Shield, you need to initialize the authentication module and configure it according to your application's requirements.

<div class="max-w-sm md:max-w-2xl" >

```jsx
import { Auth } from 'access-shield';

// Initialize the authentication instance
const auth = new Auth();

// Register a new user
auth.register('username', 'password');

// Log in an existing user
auth.login('username', 'password');

// Check if user is authenticated
if (auth.isAuthenticated()) {
  // User is authenticated, proceed with accessing secure resources
} else {
  // User is not authenticated, redirect to login page
}
```
</div>
